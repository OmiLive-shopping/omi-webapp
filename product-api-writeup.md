# Product Management API Specification

> Product management workflow for brands in the OMI Live platform

## Product CRUD Operations

### Create
- **Who**: Brands can add new products
- **Required Fields**: title, description, price, image, buy link
- **Process**: Form submission with validation

### Read
- **Display**: Products appear on brand profiles
- **Features**: Searchable and filterable product catalog
- **Access**: Public viewing for all users

### Update
- **Permissions**: Brands can edit their existing products at any time
- **Scope**: All product fields can be modified
- **Validation**: Same rules as creation apply

### Delete
- **Method**: Soft delete recommended to preserve historical data
- **Permissions**: Brand owners only
- **Impact**: Product removed from public view but data retained

## Approval Workflow

**MVP Approach**: 
- ‚úÖ Auto-approve all products
- üîç Manual review for flagged items
- üìã Admin dashboard for content moderation

## User Roles & Permissions

### Standard User
- View live streams
- Participate in chat
- Purchase products
- Basic profile management

### Brand User
**All Standard User permissions PLUS:**
- ‚ú® Create and manage products
- üì∫ Host live streams
- üìä Access brand analytics dashboard
- üè™ Manage brand profile and settings

### Technical Implementation
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control system
- **Concept**: Brands are "elevated streamers" with product management capabilities
- **Future Roles**: 
  - Brand Admin (multiple users per brand)
  - Brand Viewer (read-only access)

## Role Management Process

### Admin Capabilities
**Current Approach**: Manual admin assignment of roles

**Admin Features**:
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrade users to Brand status
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Downgrade/suspend Brand accounts
- üë• View all user roles and permissions
- üîß Bulk role management tools

### Future Automation Options
- üìù Brand application process with verification
- ü§ñ Automatic role assignment based on criteria (verified business, eco-certifications)
- üöÄ Self-service brand onboarding with approval workflow

**Best Practice**: Keep manual initially for quality control, automate as platform scales.

## Product Creation Flow

## Technical Implementation

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary recommended
- **Database**: Indexed fields for search performance
- **CDN**: Fast image loading and global distribution
- **Audit Trail**: Track all product changes for compliance

### API Endpoints Structure
```
POST   /api/v1/products              # Create product
GET    /api/v1/products              # List products (with filters)
GET    /api/v1/products/:id          # Get specific product
PUT    /api/v1/products/:id          # Update product
DELETE /api/v1/products/:id          # Soft delete product
GET    /api/v1/brands/:id/products   # Get brand's products
```

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Products Table**: Core product information
- **Product Images Table**: Multiple images per product
- **Product Categories Table**: Hierarchical categorization
- **Audit Log Table**: Track changes for compliance
- **Soft Delete**: `deleted_at` timestamp field
